# RAG-Enhanced-Speech-to-Speech-Model


**Project Description:**
This project develops an advanced speech-to-speech system powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). It leverages a RAG-driven pipeline to generate accurate and contextually relevant speech responses, enabling seamless real-time speech transformation and conversation. By combining cutting-edge retrieval techniques with speech synthesis models, the system can dynamically process and generate speech outputs, providing a robust solution for context-aware, and intelligent voice interactions.
